🌐 Step 5: Handling Typos

1. 🧠 Spelling Errors & Search Engines  
Ever wondered how a search engine still understands your query even when you mistype something like “speling” instead of “spelling”? This is where fuzzy string matching techniques like **Levenshtein Distance** and **Trigram Matching** work their magic.

Let’s explore these concepts with some interactive C++ snippets 👇

📌 i. Levenshtein Distance(Popularly known as Edit Distance Problem)
Levenshtein Distance calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into another.

Imagine comparing "kitten" and "sitting" — what’s the smallest number of edits needed to make them match? That’s exactly what we’ll solve.

```cpp
// Calculate Levenshtein Distance between two strings
int levenshteinDistance(const std::string& s1, const std::string& s2) {
    int m = s1.size(), n = s2.size();
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(m + 1, std::vector<int>(n + 1));

    for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i)
        dp[i][0] = i;
    for (int j = 0; j <= n; ++j)
        dp[0][j] = j;

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1])
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            else
                dp[i][j] = 1 + std::min({dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]});
        }
    }
    return dp[m][n];
}
```

🌎 The Algo, My Way  


⏱️ Time & Space Complexity - Levenshtein Distance  
- Time Complexity: O(m × n)  
- Space Complexity: O(m × n)  

📌 ii. Trigram Matching  
Trigrams are three-letter sequences that can represent parts of a word. Comparing trigram overlap gives a quick approximation of word similarity.

Let’s make it fun — find trigram similarity like a detective matching puzzle pieces.

```cpp
// Generate trigrams for a given word
std::set<std::string> generateTrigrams(const std::string& word) {
    std::set<std::string> trigrams;
    for (size_t i = 0; i + 2 < word.size(); ++i)
        trigrams.insert(word.substr(i, 3));
    return trigrams;
}

// Compare trigram similarity between two words
double trigramSimilarity(const std::string& word1, const std::string& word2) {
    auto t1 = generateTrigrams(word1);
    auto t2 = generateTrigrams(word2);

    int common = 0;
    for (const auto& tri : t1)
        if (t2.count(tri)) ++common;

    int total = t1.size() + t2.size();
    return total == 0 ? 0.0 : (2.0 * common) / total;
}
```

🌎 The Algo, My Way  
The more trigrams two words have in common, the more similar they are. This method is fast and useful for real-time spell correction or typo detection.

⏱️ Time & Space Complexity - Trigram Matching  
- Time Complexity: O(n) where `n` is the length of the word  
- Space Complexity: O(n)  

🔄 When to Use What?  
| Technique           | Use Case                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| Levenshtein Distance| Accurate but slower, for close match scoring |
| Trigram Matching    | Fast filtering or typo spotting    |

✅ Pro Tip: Combine both! Use trigram to shortlist and Levenshtein to rank.
