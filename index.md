## Google Services & Algorithms

Explore how Google integrates powerful algorithms behind its core services. This timeline-style format outlines how each service operates step by step, highlighting the algorithms that make them fast, scalable, and intelligent.



### 🧪 Case Study: How Google Search Delivers the Perfect Result

#### 🔍 Scenario: A User Searches for "Best DSLR Cameras"

> On a regular morning, a user types "Best DSLR Cameras for Beginners" into Google. Within milliseconds, Google presents hundreds of relevant, ranked, and refined results. But what’s happening behind the scenes?

---

#### 🛠️ Step 1: String Matching Begins

To match the query to documents, **Rabin-Karp** and **KMP** algorithms are applied for efficient pattern searching across billions of indexed web pages.  
📄 [Details](1.html)

- 📌 **Why KMP/Rabin-Karp?**  
  These algorithms offer fast and scalable substring matching by avoiding re-checking characters.

---

#### 🧠 Step 2: Autocomplete Kicks In

Before the user even finishes typing, suggestions like *"Best DSLR Cameras 2025"* pop up—thanks to **Trie** and **Ternary Search Trees** enabling prefix-based lookups in real-time.  
📄 [Details](2.html)

- 📌 **Why Tries?**  
  Tries reduce lookup time to O(L), where L is the length of the prefix.

---

#### 📈 Step 3: Page Ranking Magic

Once results are fetched, they’re sorted using **PageRank**, combined with **DFS** and **BFS** to traverse the web’s graph of interconnected pages.  
📄 [Details](3.html)

- 📌 **Why Graph Algorithms?**  
  They help evaluate importance based on the number and quality of inbound links.

---

#### 💾 Step 4: Caching for Speed

Frequently visited search results are retrieved from **LRU**, **LFU**, or **HashMap + DLL** caches, improving speed and reducing recomputation.  
📄 [Details](4.html)

- 📌 **Why Caching?**  
  To serve common queries in constant time.

---

#### 📝 Step 5: Handling Typos

If the user accidentally types "Best DSLF Cameraz", Google's spell checker steps in using **Levenshtein Distance** and **Trigram Matching** to suggest "Best DSLR Cameras".  
📄 [Details](5.html)

- 📌 **Why Edit Distance?**  
  It helps find the most likely intended query based on minimal edits.

---

#### ✅ Final Outcome:

In under 0.3 seconds, the user sees:
- Accurate search results  
- Helpful auto-suggestions  
- Corrected spellings  
- Fast load times due to caching  



---

> 🔎 **Summary**: Google Search isn’t just a black box—it’s a beautifully choreographed system where **graphs**, **tries**, **DP**, and **greedy logic** blend to serve billions daily.




### 🧪 Case Study: How Google Maps Gets You There (Fast)

#### 🗺️ Scenario: A User Navigates to a Café in Traffic in Hubballi

  - **A\***: Adds heuristics for faster routing.  
  - **Bellman-Ford**: Handles graphs with negative weights (less common, but useful in traffic prediction).

---

#### 🚦 Step 2: Live Traffic Integration

While calculating the route, Maps considers **real-time congestion** using **Dynamic Graphs** and **Real-Time A\*** updates.  
📄 [Details](7.html)

- 📌 **How It Works:**  
  - Traffic updates change edge weights dynamically.  
  - **Floyd-Warshall** helps in static all-pairs path precomputation for quick rerouting.

---

#### 🗃️ Step 3: Grouping Nearby Places

Looking for coffee shops or ATMs nearby? Maps uses **clustering** to group similar points of interest.  
📄 [Details](8.html)

- 🧠 Algorithms at Play:  
  - **Union-Find (DSU)**: For spatial grouping.  
  - **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering (no need to predefine clusters).  
  - **K-Means**: Location-based grouping.

---

#### 📍 Step 4: Regional Mapping and Boundaries

Zooming in shows neighborhood outlines, park boundaries, or lake contours—crafted using **Convex Hull** and **K-D Trees**.  
📄 [Details](9.html)

- 📌 **Why These Structures?**  
  - **Convex Hull (Graham Scan)** outlines the outer boundary of locations.  
  - **K-D Trees** enable fast spatial queries like "Find the 5 nearest places".
