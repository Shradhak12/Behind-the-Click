## Google Services & Algorithms

Explore how Google integrates powerful algorithms behind its core services. This timeline-style format outlines how each service operates step by step, highlighting the algorithms that make them fast, scalable, and intelligent.


### 🔍 Google Search – From Query to Result

1. **User enters a search query**  
   → The query is matched using **Rabin-Karp** and **KMP** string matching algorithms.  
   📄 [Details](1.html)

2. **Autocomplete suggestions appear**  
   → Generated in real-time using **Trie** and **Ternary Search Trees**.  
   📄 [Details](2.html)

3. **Relevant pages are ranked**  
   → Ranked by importance using **PageRank**, **DFS**, and **BFS** over the link graph.  
   📄 [Details](3.html)

4. **Frequently accessed results are cached**  
   → Handled by **LRU**, **LFU**, and **HashMap + DLL** based caches.  
   📄 [Details](4.html)

5. **Spelling mistakes are corrected**  
   → Corrected using **Levenshtein Distance** and **Trigram Matching**.  
   📄 [Details](5.html)

### 🗺️ Google Maps – Navigating the Real World

1. **User requests directions**  
   → Shortest paths computed using **Dijkstra's**, **A\* Search**, or **Bellman-Ford**.  
   📄 [Details](6.html)

2. **Live traffic is analyzed**  
   → Traffic estimates made using **Dynamic Graphs**, **Real-time A\***, and **Floyd-Warshall**.  
   📄 [Details](7.html)

3. **Nearby places are grouped**  
   → Clustered using **Union-Find**, **DBSCAN**, or **K-Means** algorithms.  
   📄 [Details](8.html)

4. **Regional boundaries are analyzed**  
   → Handled with **Convex Hull (Graham Scan)** and **K-D Trees** for spatial mapping.  
   📄 [Details](9.html)
