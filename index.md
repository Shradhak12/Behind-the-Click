> 📘 **APS Takeaways — From Classrooms to Clicks**  
> *“Every algorithm I learned in class found its real-world echo in this portfolio.”*

APS (Algorithmic Problem Solving) wasn’t just a subject — it was the lens through which I decoded how Google works behind the scenes. Here's how the topics taught by **Prakash Hegade Sir** helped me shape this interactive portfolio:

### 🔁 Dynamic Programming  
From YouTube’s video trend detection (using **sliding window** logic) to typo handling in Google Search (**edit distance**), dynamic programming helped break complex problems into simpler subproblems — just as we practiced in class.

### 🌐 PageRank  
One of the highlights of APS was the PageRank algorithm. In my portfolio’s Search section, I explored how **PageRank scores** determine which pages rise to the top — exactly how Google started. Understanding this from both a theoretical and applied angle was powerful.

### 🌟 Range Queries & Sparse Table  
In Google Photos, I drew inspiration from **sparse table** and **lookup tables** for tasks like timeline arrangement and photo grouping — connecting back to the range query optimizations we covered in class.

### 🚦A* and Pathfinding  
The shortest path algorithms behind Google Maps felt familiar thanks to APS. Techniques like **Dijkstra** and **A*** enabled me to explain how live route optimization is done under the hood.

### 📊 Mo's Algorithm  
While not explicitly visualized, the concept of **offline query optimization** inspired me to think about query batching — especially in scenarios like video indexing or face matching across photos in Google Photos.

> 💡 **APS helped me look at the world not just through code — but through logic.**  
> This portfolio is a direct outcome of that journey: from solving coding problems on paper to understanding how world-class systems like Google are built — one algorithm at a time.
