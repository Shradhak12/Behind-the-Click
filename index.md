# 🧪 Case Study: How Google Search Delivers the Perfect Result

### 🔍 Scenario: A User Searches for "Best DSLR Cameras"

> On a regular morning, a user types "Best DSLR Cameras for Beginners" into Google. Within milliseconds, Google presents hundreds of relevant, ranked, and refined results. But what’s happening behind the scenes?

### [🛠️ Step 1: String Matching Begins](1.html)
- **Why KMP/Rabin-Karp?**  
  Fast and scalable substring matching by avoiding re-checking characters.

### [🧠 Step 2: Autocomplete Kicks In](2.html)
- **Why Tries?**  
  Lookup time is reduced to O(L), where L is the length of the prefix.

### [📈 Step 3: Page Ranking Magic](3.html)
- **Why Graph Algorithms?**  
  They evaluate importance based on the number and quality of inbound links.

### [💾 Step 4: Caching for Speed](4.html)
- **Why Caching?**  
  To serve common queries in constant time.

### [📝 Step 5: Handling Typos](5.html)
- **Why Edit Distance?**  
  Finds the most likely intended query using minimal edits.

# ✅ Final Outcome
- Accurate search results  
- Helpful auto-suggestions  
- Corrected spellings  
- Fast load times due to caching

> 🔎 **Summary**: Google Search isn’t just a black box—it’s a beautifully choreographed system where **graphs**, **tries**, **DP**, and **greedy logic** blend to serve billions daily.
