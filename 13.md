## 📍 Search in Gmail
# 1. 🔍 Why Inverted Index?
While exploring how Gmail efficiently searches through massive volumes of emails, I realized it's not scanning every email line by line. Instead, it uses a clever trick: Inverted Indexing. This structure maps each word to all the emails it appears in, making search lightning fast.

📌 i. Inverted Index (Gmail Functionality)
An Inverted Index is like a reverse dictionary: instead of mapping emails to the words they contain, it maps words to the list of emails they appear in.

Here’s how I wrote a basic version in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

class InvertedIndex {
    unordered_map<string, set<int>> index;

public:
    void addEmail(int id, const string& text) {
        istringstream iss(text);
        string word;
        while (iss >> word) {
            index[word].insert(id);
        }
    }

    set<int> search(const string& word) {
        if (index.count(word)) {
            return index[word];
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```
## 🌍 The Algo, My Way
-I broke each email into words and stored the email ID under each word in a map.

-Searching is fast: O(1) lookup to find which emails contain a word.

-Perfect for apps where content lookup happens frequently and speed matters.
