# 🗺️ Step 4: Regional Mapping and Boundaries

📍 Defining Regions in Maps  
While exploring location data, I noticed how maps neatly display neighborhood outlines, parks, lakes, and regions. These aren't random — they're shaped by geometric algorithms. That’s where **Convex Hull** and **K-D Trees** come into play!

---

## 📌 i. Convex Hull (Graham Scan)
Convex Hull helps draw the **outer boundary** around a group of points — imagine outlining the edges of a lake or a city's perimeter.

Here’s how I implemented it using Graham Scan:

```algorithm
Initialize p as leftmost point. 
Do following while we don’t come back to the first (or leftmost) point. 
The next point q is the point, such that the triplet (p, q, r) is counter clockwise for any other point r. To find this, we simply initialize q as next point, then we traverse through all points. For any point i, if i is more counter clockwise, i.e., orientation(p, i, q) is counter clockwise, then we update q as i. Our final value of q is going to be the most counter clockwise point. 
next[p] = q (Store q as next of p in the output convex hull). 
p = q (Set p as q for next iteration).
```

## 📌 ii. K-D Trees for Spatial Search
K-D Trees are amazing when you want to quickly find nearby locations — like “nearest hospitals” or “5 closest fuel stations”.

Here’s a basic K-D Tree construction and query:

```cpp
// A C++ program to demonstrate operations of KD tree
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int k = 2;

// A structure to represent node of kd tree
struct Node
{
    int point[k]; // To store k dimensional point
    Node *left, *right;
};

// A method to create a node of K D tree
struct Node* newNode(int arr[])
{
    struct Node* temp = new Node;

    for (int i=0; i<k; i++)
       temp->point[i] = arr[i];

    temp->left = temp->right = NULL;
    return temp;
}

// Inserts a new node and returns root of modified tree
// The parameter depth is used to decide axis of comparison
Node *insertRec(Node *root, int point[], unsigned depth)
{
    // Tree is empty?
    if (root == NULL)
       return newNode(point);

    // Calculate current dimension (cd) of comparison
    unsigned cd = depth % k;

    // Compare the new point with root on current dimension 'cd'
    // and decide the left or right subtree
    if (point[cd] < (root->point[cd]))
        root->left  = insertRec(root->left, point, depth + 1);
    else
        root->right = insertRec(root->right, point, depth + 1);

    return root;
}

// Function to insert a new point with given point in
// KD Tree and return new root. It mainly uses above recursive
// function "insertRec()"
Node* insert(Node *root, int point[])
{
    return insertRec(root, point, 0);
}

// A utility method to determine if two Points are same
// in K Dimensional space
bool arePointsSame(int point1[], int point2[])
{
    // Compare individual pointinate values
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
        if (point1[i] != point2[i])
            return false;

    return true;
}

// Searches a Point represented by "point[]" in the K D tree.
// The parameter depth is used to determine current axis.
bool searchRec(Node* root, int point[], unsigned depth)
{
    // Base cases
    if (root == NULL)
        return false;
    if (arePointsSame(root->point, point))
        return true;

    // Current dimension is computed using current depth and total
    // dimensions (k)
    unsigned cd = depth % k;

    // Compare point with root with respect to cd (Current dimension)
    if (point[cd] < root->point[cd])
        return searchRec(root->left, point, depth + 1);

    return searchRec(root->right, point, depth + 1);
}

// Searches a Point in the K D tree. It mainly uses
// searchRec()
bool search(Node* root, int point[])
{
    // Pass current depth as 0
    return searchRec(root, point, 0);
}


```

### ✅ When to Use Which?

#### 🧭 Use **Convex Hull** when:
- You need to outline a region’s outer boundary (like **parks**, **lakes**, or **neighborhoods**).
- You're shaping visible map elements with **minimal enclosing geometry**.

#### 🔍 Use **K-D Tree** when:
- You want to perform quick **location-based queries** like “nearest X”.
- Ideal for **dynamic spatial searches** in maps or **location-based services**.
