# 🌐  Step 3: Page Ranking Magic

### 1. 🧠 PageRank & Graph Traversals
Ever wondered how search engines decide which page appears at the top when you search for something? A huge part of that magic is **PageRank**, a graph-based algorithm developed by Google’s founders. But wait, graph traversal methods like **DFS** and **BFS** also sneak into the backend when dealing with crawling or link analysis.

Let’s decode how this works 👇

## 📌 i. PageRank
The web is treated like a **directed graph** where each page is a node and hyperlinks are edges. PageRank assigns a score to each page based on how many other pages link to it — and how important those pages are.

Imagine it like a popularity contest: If a popular person vouches for you (links to your page), your reputation (PageRank) improves.

Here's a simple version of PageRank in code:

```python
def compute_pagerank(graph, d=0.85, iterations=100):
    N = len(graph)
    pagerank = {node: 1 / N for node in graph}

    for _ in range(iterations):
        new_rank = {}
        for node in graph:
            rank_sum = 0
            for other in graph:
                if node in graph[other]:
                    rank_sum += pagerank[other] / len(graph[other])
            new_rank[node] = (1 - d) / N + d * rank_sum
        pagerank = new_rank

    return pagerank
```

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity - PageRank
- **Time Complexity**: O(N × E × I), where N = number of nodes, E = edges, I = iterations
- **Space Complexity**: O(N)

## 📌 ii. DFS & BFS for Web Crawling
While PageRank ranks the pages, algorithms like **DFS (Depth First Search)** and **BFS (Breadth First Search)** help in **web crawling** — i.e., discovering pages and links.

- **DFS**: Goes deep into a link chain before backtracking. Might miss out on breadth.
- **BFS**: Explores all neighbors first. Better for finding shortest paths or shallow-level content.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Recursive function for DFS traversal
void dfsRec(vector<vector<int>> &adj, vector<bool> &visited, int s, vector<int> &res)
{

    visited[s] = true;

    res.push_back(s);

    // Recursively visit all adjacent vertices
    // that are not visited yet
    for (int i : adj[s])
        if (visited[i] == false)
            dfsRec(adj, visited, i, res);
}

// Main DFS function that initializes the visited array
// and call DFSRec
vector<int> DFS(vector<vector<int>> &adj)
{
    vector<bool> visited(adj.size(), false);
    vector<int> res;
    dfsRec(adj, visited, 0, res);
    return res;
}

// To add an edge in an undirected graph
void addEdge(vector<vector<int>> &adj, int s, int t)
{
    adj[s].push_back(t);
    adj[t].push_back(s);
}

```

## 🔄 Comparison: PageRank vs BFS/DFS

| Feature              | PageRank                 | DFS/BFS               |
|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Ranking web pages         | Crawling or discovery |
| **Input**           | Directed graph            | Graph                  |
| **Output**          | Rank of each node         | Traversal order       |
| **Time Complexity** | O(N × E × I)              | O(N + E)              |
| **Space**           | O(N)                      | O(N)                  |
| **Iterative?**      | Yes (repeated updates)    | Usually once          |

### ✅ When to Use Which?
- **Use PageRank** when you need to **score and prioritize** pages.
- **Use BFS/DFS** when you’re focused on **discovering or crawling** pages efficiently.
