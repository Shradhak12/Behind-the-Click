### In This Portfolio
In this portfolio, I’ve analyzed and mapped various Google services like **Google Maps**, **YouTube**, **Gmail**, **Google Search**, and more — each through the lens of algorithms that make them fast, intelligent, and scalable.

> 🧠 *“Algorithms are not just problems to solve — they are the engines behind everyday tech that billions rely on.”*

This is not just a collection of solutions. It is a **deep dive into understanding, structuring, and explaining** how core computer science concepts drive some of the most advanced systems in the world.

Whether it’s **Dijkstra’s Algorithm for routing**, **Tries for autocomplete**, or **KMP for string matching**, each concept is tied to a real-world use case from Google — explained with clarity, relevance, and enthusiasm.

### Purpose
My goal is simple:
- 🔍 **To understand DSA through the products we use every day**
- 💡 **To connect theory with impactful applications**
- 📖 **To showcase my love for clean code, problem-solving, and computer science**
- 🧑‍💻 **To build a portfolio worthy of my dream — working at Google**

### What’s Inside?
Inside this portfolio, you'll find:
- 💥 Clear and crisp explanations of each algorithm  
- 🔍 Real-life use cases from Google’s product suite  
- 🧠 Time & space complexities  
- 💻 Code implementations with comments  
- 🚀 Insights into why a particular algorithm fits the problem

Let’s dive into the world of Google through the lens of DSA — one algorithm at a time.
