## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to my **Algorithmic Problem Solving Portfolio**, where I combine my passion for **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** with the real-world power of **Google’s ecosystem**.

In this portfolio, I’ve analyzed and mapped various Google services like **Google Maps**, **YouTube**, **Gmail**, **Google Search**, and more — each through the lens of algorithms that make them fast, intelligent, and scalable.

> 🧠 *“Algorithms are not just problems to solve — they are the engines behind everyday tech that billions rely on.”*

This is not just a collection of solutions. It is a **deep dive into understanding, structuring, and explaining** how core computer science concepts drive some of the most advanced systems in the world.

Whether it’s **Dijkstra’s Algorithm for routing**, **Tries for autocomplete**, or **KMP for string matching**, each concept is tied to a real-world use case from Google — explained with clarity, relevance, and enthusiasm.
